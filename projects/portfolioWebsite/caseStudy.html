<h2>Project Brief</h2>
<a href="projectBrief.html">Project Brief</a>
<h2>Development Process</h2>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Total planning time: 1 hour</p>
<ul>
<li>Defined achievable core requirements that will serve as the foundation for future development iterations of the website. These sections provide a comprehensive overview of professional identity and work.</li>
<li>Decided on a minimalist approach using only HTML for the initial version. This was done to keep focus on content structure and rapid deployment.</li>
<li>Defined a formal project creation process. By creating a project brief and case study, the development process and design choices of each project are documented for future analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>Total development time: 2.5 hours</p>
<h4>Key Findings</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Rendering</strong><br />
Challenge: How to display Markdown content on the website<br />
Process: Researched methods for rendering Markdown content</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Considered client-side rendering with JavaScript libraries</p>
</li>
<li>Opted for pre-converting Markdown to HTML</li>
</ul>
<p>Outcome: Better SEO and simpler initial implementation, aligning with the goal of a solid foundation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Image Generation for Articles</strong><br />
Challenge: Finding appropriate images for articles<br />
Process: Used AI (Gemini) to generate custom images. Images aren't perfect but that adds to the appeal<br />
Outcome: Avoided copyright concerns and created unique, relevant visuals efficiently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using AI for Development</strong><br />
Challenge: Extracting development value by prompting an LLM<br />
Process: Wrote HTML and content using <a href="https://claude.ai">Claude.ai</a> due to familiarity<br />
Outcome: Leveraged AI to draft content quickly, allowing focus on overall structure and implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Website Hosting</strong><br />
Challenge: How to host the website on the Internet<br />
Process: Elected to host on Github Pages due to it being free and existing familiarity<br />
Outcome: Website became publically available</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Languages Used: HTML</li>
